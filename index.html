			<p>Hey, My name is Obataiye and I am a Richmond, VA based software engineer. I love all things tech especially programming and gaming and I aspire to be a great developer one day!
			
			Currently I'm familiarizing myself with a number of different technologies including:</p>

			<ol>
				<li>HTML</li>
				<li>CSS</li>
				<li>JavaScript</li>
			</ol>
			
			
			<h3>About Me</h3>
			<p>After receiving a copy of the software Game Engine as a christmas present as a child, I developed a love for programming and computer science. After attending college and obtaining my Associates Degree in computer science, I felt that I needed to expand more on my technical skills. As a student at <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/">Thinkful</a> I hope to gain those skills needed to survive and even thrive in today's competitive tech industry. Of course I have other passions outside of programming including:</p>

			<ul>
			<li>Gaming: I've always been a big fan of gaming and in fact, playing videogames as a child helped fuel my passion for programming.</li>
			<li>Self Development: I'm always striving to improve myself! Whether in fitness, programming, or simply learning a new concept, I love to push myself and discover new things.</li>
			<li>Finance: You could say I'm a bit of a numbers guy, I've always been fascinated by stocks, investing, and the science behind money and wealth building.</li>
			</ul>
